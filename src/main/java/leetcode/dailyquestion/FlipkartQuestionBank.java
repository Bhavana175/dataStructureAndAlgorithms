    1. find the median of two sorted arrays
    2. Find k maximum elements in a stream of integers
    3. Dsa question of Distribution of candies
    4. Coding round questions - one on graphs - djikstra's algorithm was used, other two on

   5. dynamic programming(DP) - one digit DP and other similar to unbounded knapsack

        Binary search, Priority Queue, Array and Trees. As per my information quite a
        few time dynamic programming questions could also be asked, so you can practice a
        few popular questions of DP and it would help solve other similar DP problems if asked.

        https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/design-a-stack-that-supports-getmin-in-o1-time-and-o1-extra-space/
        Design a stack which holds an integer value such that getMinimum() function should return the minimum element in the stack.
        FOLLOW UP: Implement popMin() function which would pop minimum element from the original stack.
        O(1) implementation was required. (Hint: Use LinkedList to implement stack and store address
        of minimum element node in min-stack)

        Print an organisational hierarchy.

        The first question was DUPLICATES IN BST. So I again came up with an O(n) approach using
         inorder traversal and then storing it in a vector and then just applying an “IF” check
          in it. She told me to code it. I completed writing my code within a few minutes.
          She then told me not to use any vector this time. I again came up with the approach
          in less than a minute. This time I just keep track of the previously visited element in O(1) space complexity.
          I again completed writing my code within a few minutes. She again made changes to the question
          she now told me not to print it as many times as it appears. For this, I used one
          more variable to keep track of the already printed answer. She now told me to
          dry-run this on the given test case. And she seems to be very satisfied with all
          of my approaches. I already took 10 minutes to code all three approaches and dry-running them.

        The second question was finding the longest substring with all the unique characters. I
        used the variable-sized sliding window algorithm to code it in the O(n) approach.
        She again seems to be very satisfied. Then I was again asked to dry-run
        the algorithm against the given test case.
